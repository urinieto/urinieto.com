Hola! I am Oriol (Uri) Nieto (he/they), a Senior Audio Research Engineer in the Sound Design AI Group at [Adobe Research][1]. I was a Staff Scientist at Pandora before that. I also [make music](https://www.urinieto.com/music-videos/).

{{< img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/uri-yosemite.jpg" alt="" title="uri" width="240" height="350" class="" >}}

My main [research](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~urinieto/MARL/publications.php) focuses on machine learning and signal processing applied to audio signals: from understanding to generation, including multi-modal models with text, image, and video; diffusion models for conditional audio generation; contrastive and, more generally, representation learning; music information retrieval; large-scale music recommendation systems; and open source software and data frameworks. 
I have contributed to Premiere Pro with several new AI technologies, including [Audio Category Tagging](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/audio-auto-tagging.html).
I am one of the original authors of the popular audio processing Python framework [librosa](https://librosa.org/).
I hold a Ph.D in Music Technology from the [Music and Audio Research Lab][6] at the New York University. You can see all my publications, including my Ph.D Dissertation, [here][3].

I am an active member of the [ISMIR](https://ismir.net/) community, either as an author, reviewer, meta-reviewer, and/or organization chair since 2012.
I am General Co-Chair of [ISMIR 2024](https://ismir2024.ismir.net/), which will be held in San Francisco, CA, in November 2024.

I sing, play guitar, violin, and drums for the psychedelic, depressive, humorous, transatlantic, and transcontinental band [La Bossa d'Urina](http://labossadurina.com). I play cajón, guitars, and sing for the rumba band [Rumbahía](https://open.spotify.com/artist/33eHLBhvDL2U5Xaar4Quel?si=32VQzSBiQGiO98g_wj9D7Q). I was the singer of [Arkaen](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0JrPYalpR8Tnzln37ZQUSI?si=RmWGGL1tSUabK2XS1GBPxw). I was the singer, guitarist, and violinist of [Sargon](https://www.facebook.com/sargonmetal/) for 10 years, and I am the creator of the SCREAMINATOR, the [Growl Hero](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~urinieto/256/growlhero/index.html), and the [Ultimate Screaming Lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dAdsOjVChI&list=PL473A703483112034). I am also the director of **Jarl'em All Studios**, in ~~Harlem, Brooklyn~~ Oakland, California. 

I was the teacher of the courses [C Programming for Music Technology][7] and [Applications on iOS Platform](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~urinieto/MARL/iOS/) at NYU. I also worked alongside with [Jordan Rudess][8] from [Dream Theater][9] and Kevin Chartier developing some cool Music Apps for the iOS Platform. I helped them with the [MorphWiz][10] and the [SketchWiz][11], really cool apps you can find on the AppStore. I used to develop iOS apps myself, but Python has taken over my life.

This blog is about technology, music, traveling, books, politics, geek stuff, and some other ineffectual things that give meaning to my life. 

For more info about me, please refer to [my formal CV][13].
