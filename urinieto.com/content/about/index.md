Hello World! I am Oriol Nieto (aka Uri Nieto), a Staff Scientist at [Pandora][1]. I also make music.

{{< img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/uri.png" alt="" title="uri" width="240" height="350" class="" >}}

I hold a Ph.D in Music Data Science from the [Music and Audio Research Lab][6] at the New York University. You can see all my publications, including my Ph.D Dissertation, [here][3]. My interests focus on music information retrieval, large scale recommendation systems, and machine learning with especial emphasis on deep architectures.

I sing, play guitar, violin, and drums for the psychedelic, depressive, humorous, transatlantic, and transcontinental band [La Bossa d'Urina](http://labossadurina.com). I was the singer, guitarist and violinist of [Sargon](https://www.facebook.com/sargonmetal/) for 10 years, and I am the creator of the SCREAMINATOR, the [Growl Hero](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~urinieto/256/growlhero/index.html), and the [Ultimate Screaming Lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dAdsOjVChI&list=PL473A703483112034). I am also the director of **Jarl'em All Studios**, in ~~Harlem~~ ~~Brooklyn~~ Oakland, California. This just means that I have a mini home studio and that I like to give fancy names to random things.

I was the teacher of the courses [C Programming for Music Technology][7] and [Applications on iOS Platform](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~urinieto/MARL/iOS/) at NYU. I also worked alongside with [Jordan Rudess][8] from [Dream Theater][9] and Kevin Chartier developing some cool Music Apps for the iOS Platform. I helped them with the [MorphWiz][10] and the [SketchWiz][11], really cool apps you can find on the AppStore. I used to develop iOS apps myself, but Python has taken over my life.

This blog is about technology, music, traveling, books, politics, geek stuff, and some other ineffectual things that give meaning to my life. 

For more info about me, please refer to [my formal CV][13].
