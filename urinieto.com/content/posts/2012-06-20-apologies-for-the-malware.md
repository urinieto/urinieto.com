Apparently, google found some malware on my site last week. I have no idea where it came from or why it was here. I promise I have nothing to do with it. After contacting my server, they run an antivirus and problem solved. Time to upgrade my wordpress.

In any case, if you saw that, I apology for any inconveniences I may have caused. Ahhh technology and the future&#8230;

Anybody out there with wordpress and the same issue?
