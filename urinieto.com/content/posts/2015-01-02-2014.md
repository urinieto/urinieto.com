The perception of the amount of time a year lasts follows an inverted exponential curve that depends on your age. Thus, for me this year lasted half the time 2013 lasted. Nevertheless, 2014 has been full of _things_ that I will chronologically list such that my dysfunctional memory does not need to store them anymore:

  * I start the year at the Hospital because a monkey bit me in Mexico
  * [Cover of Ending Theme (by Pain Of Salvation)][1]
  * **Midnight Blue** is my new metal band. I&#8217;m the vocalist and it&#8217;s a lot of fun
  * The Longest Winter in NY
  * [I present the 2D-FMC method][2] at NEMISIG 2014 in Columbia University
  * iPython Notebook is the new best thing as a developer
  * I switch back to MacVim and I become much happier
  * The Old School comes to NY and we spend The Best Week Ever (thanks for organizing it Nat! :*)
  * Playing with Eren Başbuğ and Alek Darson at Berklee College
  * [Cover of Harvest (by Opeth)][3]
  * We leave our beautiful apartment in Brooklyn and go to Europe for a month
  * Dublin for a day: beer, whiskey, jetlag, and leprechauns
  * [Presented the 2D-FMC method][4] at ICASSP 2014
  * Barcelona at the speed of light: crazy ISMIR deadline, and [Thin Bag of Urine World Tour 2014][5]
  * We move to Lima, Perú, for 2.5 months
  * I watch the World Cup for the first time in my life (and people in Peru are crazy about it)
  * I start writing my PhD Dissertation
  * [Cover of Trains (by Porcupine Tree)][6]
  * The food in Perú is extremely good, and Isabel&#8217;s cuisine is probably the best in the world
  * We visit Cusco and the Sacred Valley (including Machu Picchu) and it is probably the most beautiful place in the world
  * We go back to Brooklyn and find a nice apartment in the heart of Crown Heights
  * [Teaching C Programming again][7]
  * I collaborate with Ractica and we publish [this song][8], which is awesome
  * [International cover of The Trooper by Iron Maiden][9]
  * When everything is out of the moving boxes and the apartment looks like home, Bedbugs arrive
  * ISMIR in Taipei. The best conference. [So][10] [many][11] [papers][12] [this][13] [year][14] ([one][15] of them wins the best poster award :))
  * [International cover of Thriller by Michael Jackson][16]
  * We stop eating meat in the US
  * The epic moment comes: I submit my PhD Dissertation
  * We spend the Holidays in Barcelona with Nat, family, and friends

Happy 2015 everyone titanics!
