Another year in review. Seriously though, time is moving way too fast. Seems like I just wrote the little review for 2018 a month ago. Anyway, here it is. Life is good and also a piece of shit. But mostly good.

Also, so much travel this year. Look at all the places I&#8217;ve been, and then cry because of the indecent amount of CO2 emitted by all those planes I took:
