This way of _spiraling_ around the sun is getting out of control. 
The year 12,025 of the [Human Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar) came and went.
The first half is full of trips around a few continents, and my second half takes place mostly in California.
I raft the Grand Canyon and have an "I see the light" type of moment when I thought I was about to die.
I climb regularly and can finally send some V5s and flash some V4s!
I present a demo in front of over 7k people at Adobe MAX in LA!
They discover I have a genetic condition and have to start medication as it's appropriate to successfully approach the middle ages.
We rescue the best dog in the world: [Mica, The Nihilist](https://www.instagram.com/micathenihilist), and our hearts melt.

Here I go with the list that can somewhat summarize my 12,025:

- Start of the year in Barcelona and Andorra
- We land in Los Angeles a few hours after some of the most devastating [wildfires](https://www.instagram.com/p/DEkvb_Yy0ds/)
- I switch to Cursor + Claude and the way I work fundamentally changes (mindblown, and this is only the beginning)
- I go to NYC and give a talk about Generative Sound Design at NYU
- We go to Colorado and ski in the [Rockies](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHRiMsPPaWr/?img_index=1) with my sisterina
- Anita and I run the [Oakland Half](https://www.instagram.com/p/DHkfmv4xyfF/?img_index=1) (Anita's first Half Marathon)!
- Utah with Anita's friends, spending most of the time in a giant mansion with 20+ other beautiful humans
- I go to [Hyderabad for a week](https://www.instagram.com/p/DIG28B4Ia8y/?img_index=1) to present some of our work at ICASSP (keynote at [SALMA](https://salmaworkshop.github.io/) and oral presentation of [Sketch2Sound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08550))
- Beautiful [Sant Jordi](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI-IqfOv2lC/?img_index=1) in Oakland
- One of my dreams comes true: Play the violin for the show celebrating the 20th anniversary of [Orion's Belt](https://open.spotify.com/album/7t2tYvedgGUYPSs1Xk21l7?si=HkiRzaJ0ToCqD4kOD7Z7zg) by Madee (one of my favorite albums of all time) _with Madee_ [Live in Barcelona](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ2sHnHIpOJ/?img_index=1). I cry during the last song. It is well beyond epic
- [Yosemite with our friends](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLB19pnO8bd/). Still, so many years later, one of my favorite places on this spinning rock
- "Honeymoon in Nicaragua" for 4th of July. [Gorgeous](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLfkFKOPHbS/)!
- Bay Area hikes remain [_epic_](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMEe11SPAE9/?img_index=1)
- Go to Colorado for a long weekend to camp in the rockies to celebrate my good friend's 40th birthday (Eric-ah, come here)
- My extended family, Ferran, comes with his girlfriend to spend a few weeks in Oakland and we see more [epic stuff](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMrU10_xZBG/?img_index=1) during our hikes
- We go to LA to see [Jesuschrist Superstar](https://www.instagram.com/p/DM4eBMouRqR/) with my in-laws and my mind is absolutely blown
- [NIN](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNCv8lvucvt/?img_index=1) in Oakland (first show of their American tour!)
- We raft the [Grand Canyon](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNzfG4z3Lif/?img_index=1) in a non-commercial trip for 10 days and it becomes the most wild and intense adventure of my life. For the first time ever, I was quite sure I was about to die when I fell off the raft. I am absolutely obsessed and in love with this majestic and titanic place on Earth. Also very happy to be alive
- They find I have a genetic disease and need medication to avoid potential life-threatening risks. Luckily, I can keep a completely normal life.
- We rescue [Mica](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPS8L1VDsmu/?img_index=2), the most incredible dog in the world. She comes from a rescue up in Sonoma. She is very fearful of everyone except for Anita and I. She loves us so much and we are over the moon with her. Eternal love for Mica.
- I finally see [The Flaming Lips](https://www.instagram.com/p/DOVOrqWjmRs/?img_index=1) live, and it is indeed as good as everyone told me it would be
- I don't go to ISMIR this year and I am sad about it
- I present [Project Sound Stager](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~urinieto/MARL/publications/CHI26-soundstager.pdf) at [Adobe MAX Sneaks 2026](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQcwTy9EmdN/?img_index=1). It is the most thrilling presentation I've given in my life (giving a live demo over 7k people in the Peacock Theater in LA!). I was so fucking nervous. The [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOz_CsQKcz8) gets over 600k views! :O
- WASPAA at Lake Tahoe is wonderful and we present [SILA](https://sonalkum.github.io/SILA/)
- Thanksgiving in SoCal is lovely!
- [Blind Guardian](https://www.instagram.com/p/DSNlGKTj09H/) in Berkeley make me feel young again. I go into the moshpit!
- Christmas in [SoCal](https://www.instagram.com/p/DS1SmPNlGVN/) is lovely!
- We spend NYE in San Francisco with some friends and Fantastic Negrito. What a wonderful way to end this 12,025! <3
