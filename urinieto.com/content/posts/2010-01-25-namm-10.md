Last weekend the [NAMM Show 10&#8242;][1] took place like every year in [Anaheim, L.A.][2], but this year I was invited to go and I must say that being there has been such an amazing experience.

{{< img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/02/NAMM_show.svg/500px-NAMM_show.svg.png" title="The NAMM Show" class="aligncenter" width="500" height="140" >}} 

First of all, I got invited to the NAMM thanks to Joachim Ganseman, a visitor PhD student at [CCRMA][3] that managed to get invitations for all Master Students at this department.

It was my first time in L.A., and this city is \*huge\*. We had to cross most part of it in order to get into the Anaheim Convention Center (where NAMM takes place), and it took us like 2 hours to do that. And this Convention Center turned out to be so big and so crowded that even the cellphone network was constantly going down.

Hundreds of expositors (around 1,500) were there, and every single music related brand was there. Roland, Universal Audio, Mesa/Boogie, Ibanez, Tama, Dw, VicFirth, Elixir Strings, Boss, Fender, Marshall, Ernie Ball, Shure, Dean Markley, Mackie, ESP, ENGL, etc, etc, etc. Basically everything. You get the idea.

We could see from the latest audio processing card with crazy high-speed DSP stuff to the latest Steve Vai guitar being held by an amazing statue of Steve Vai himself. From metal heads to DJ audio technology guys. From Melissa Cross to Joe Satriani. From Vinnie Paul to Slash.

I got to talk to [Melissa Cross][4] and told her about my [Growl Hero][5] project. She was really interested! I also talked to [Jordan Rudess][6] from [Dream Theater][7] about it, and he replied an email and he apparently is willing to do some work with the [iPhone Stanford Orchestra][8]!

Some other achievements: Signs from Slash (Guns&#8217;n&#8217;Roses), Paul Gilbert (Mr. Big), Andy Timmons, Chris Broderick (Megadeth), Tony MacAlpine (Planet X), John Myung (Dream Theater), John Petrucci (Dream Theater) and Steve Lukather (Toto).

Here some pictures, but you can check my [Flickr Album][9] to see all of them!
