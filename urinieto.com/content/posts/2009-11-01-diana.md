**Diana** (or _Dynamic Interactive Audio and Noise Analyzer_) is a small piece of software that I wrote as an assignment for the course [Music, Computing, and Design I][1], taught by [Ge Wang][2] at [CCRMA][3]. 

It analyzes the signal from your default input and shows it in a nice OpenGL 3D way. It also implements a simple pitch detection algorithm to tell you what note you are whistling. You can find the [source code, download and more info here][4].

The program is quite cool (and pretty useless too), and I had a lot of fun writing it, but what I like the most is its name. And now some awesome screenshots:
