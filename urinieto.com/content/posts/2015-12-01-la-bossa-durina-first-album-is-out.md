Here it is titans. Our first album with [La Bossa d&#8217;Urina][1] is finally available to buy, download, stream, urinate, etc. I still can&#8217;t believe we did this, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier with the result. Big ALRIGHT to [Ramón Rodríguez][2], who not only believed that we could do a fucking awesome album, but he also produced it and released it with [Cydonia Records][3]. Having made this with Dani Bolsa, my best friend from elementary school, is probably the best present for my doctoral graduation I could ever had. Oh man, this life is so weird, beautiful, and a piece of shit. So happy right now!
