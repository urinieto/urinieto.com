While programming for the iPhone, this questions raised in my head:

  * Why is it important that [Sawyer][1] returns to the Temple?
  * What is [Sayid][2] infected with?
  * What has &#8220;claimed&#8221; [Sayid][2]?
  * Why is [Ethan][3] using his family name? 
      * Why did he use the last name &#8220;Rom&#8221; on the Island?
  * Where has [Claire][4] been?
  * Why does the date on [Claire][4]&#8216;s sonogram indicate that the Flash-sideways timeline is a month ahead?
  * Why does [Justin][5] claim that [the Others][6] can&#8217;t kill [one of them][7]?
  * Why do [the survivors][8] need to be protected?
  * What is in the box that Sawyer kept in his and Juliet&#8217;s former home?
  * What was Aldo trying to stop Justin from saying when they found the Russeau-like trap?

And now that I read [this article][9] from the [Lostipedia][10], I can continue programming safely.
