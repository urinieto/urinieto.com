Finally, and after 2 years without a digital camera, I bought a [Sony Cybershot DSC-WX9][1]. And it&#8217;s amazing. First camera with HD I&#8217;ve ever had and love it so far. I still have to play a lot with it, but first impression is simply &#8220;ahhh finally, that was what I was looking for!&#8221;.
