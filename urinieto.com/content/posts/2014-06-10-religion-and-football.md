&#8220;Football is an organized religion and FIFA is its church. Just think about it: its leader is infallible, it compels south American countries to spend money they don&#8217;t have building opulent cathedrals (huge stadiums in Brazil), and it may ultimately be responsible for the deaths of shocking numbers of people in the middle-east (FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022). BUT, for millions of people around the world, like me, it is also the guardian of the only thing that gives their lives any meaning. And if that comparison does not make Americans love soccer, then frankly nothing will.&#8221;

This guy is a genius.
