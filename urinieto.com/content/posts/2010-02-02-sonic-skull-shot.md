I&#8217;ve been working on this application for the iPhone called [Sonic Skull Shot (SSS)][1] for the past week as an assignment for the course [_Mobile Music_][2], taught by Professor [Ge Wang][3].

It is a nice OpenGL application for the iPhone that makes use of the accelerometer and some touches to create a sling shot to throw skulls while synthezising some sound. It took me so many hours to do that, but in the end I think the result is pretty good.

You can download it from [here][1]!
