Yesterday at **[MARL][1]** (Music and Audio Research Laboratory at [NYU][2]) we had the pleasure to have a talk by **Eyal Amir**, the musician, composer, and producer behind [ProjectRnL][3].

He talked about how he &#8220;decomposes&#8221; a simple song from a musical style that he might not be familiar with and then he brings it to his own world, a world full of impossible rhythms, jazzy chords, and without any tempo / harmony restrictions. 

He focused on his extraordinary [cover of Slim Shady][4] (by Eminem), and he showed us his original mix, and how he deals with the new rhythms, based on Eminem&#8217;s lead vocals line. It was so great to have Eyal in the department, people were fascinated with his job.

Thanks for coming Eyal, we had a great time!
