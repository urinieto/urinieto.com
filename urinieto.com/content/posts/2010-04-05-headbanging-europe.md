For the past 2 years I have been headbanging every European city I&#8217;ve been to. And somebody has recorded it. Now I have put it altogether and this video is the result. I wish I could have _headbanged_ every country in Europe, but there are too many and I simply don&#8217;t have the money.

The song is called Bleed and is from the Swedish metal band **[Meshuggah][1]**, which you all should listen to and buy all their albums and go to all their concerts (yes, all of them).

PS: Scandinavian countries are missing, but they are pure metal and they don&#8217;t need another long haired guy headbanging their cities. They have plenty of them already.  
PS2: Thanks for the inspiration [Matt][2]!
