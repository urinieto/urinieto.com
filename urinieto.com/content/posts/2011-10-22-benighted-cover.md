I&#8217;ve been playing this one for a long time. It&#8217;s one of my favorite Opeth songs. I finally recorded it with a (relatively) decent equipment at **Jarl&#8217;em All Studios**, and when **Eyal Amir**, from ProjectRnL, listened to it, he proposed me to do a video of this cover.

And it&#8217;s the best solo video I&#8217;ve ever had. And here it is. And I hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed creating it:

Thanks Eyal for doing this!
