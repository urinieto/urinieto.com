Last week I had the honor to give an invited talk at the 2nd International Symposium on Distorted Vocals in São Paulo, Brazil. The titan Ariel Coelho was the main organizer, and fantastic speakers such as Melissa Cross were also invited.

My talk was about analyzing screams using different types of spectrograms, and finally train a neural network classifier to try to detect extreme vocal effects. Here you have the video, hope you enjoy it, titans!
