Goodbye 2018, hello 2019. Some delay in writing this, only justifiable by the bliss I am nowadays feeling. And also by too much traveling. Here I go once again, with the list of items that made my life more or less meaningful during this past 2018.

  * Crazy start of the year in snowy NYC with my buddy Eduard.
  * My dearest friend Dani comes to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeJKemjHxdX/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">visit me</a> in the Bay Area and we go to Vegas + Zion.
  * Rocking with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeoKf9TnPGK/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arkaen</a>, opening for the titans of Dio Disciples.
  * The break-up from 2017 still keeps me awake at night. Never imagined this could be this bad.
  * Beautiful <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BfWsYaxAbbA/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hikes</a> around the Bay Area with some new and old friends.
  * I play two shows with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BfsUdMIAiY8/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jordan Rudess</a>: one in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfz0slrAW_z/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pandora</a>, and another at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BgDX5BZgGCf/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yoshi&#8217;s</a>. This not only includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srF5KSOH_gE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">playing one of my favorite Dream Theater tunes</a> (which he co-composed) with him, but also playing one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RfREShyCRU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tunes from La Bossa d&#8217;Urina</a> that I composed with him. I can die happy now.
  * My love for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhA1-TYA_Ct/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tahoe</a> keeps growing.
  * Cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY0PXJH2Hhk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Nurse Who Loved Me</a>, by A Perfect Circle.
  * The shows with Rumbahía become <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhQv6PvhB5O/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more epic</a>.
  * I visit Barcelona in April and my friends and I have a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhloZQbhhub/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wonderful catàrsi</a>.
  * <a href="http://ai-4-all.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AI4ALL</a> is an organization that aims to help diversify the field of AI. I become one of the mentors, and for 3 months I mentor a 15 year old female student to build a music recommender system with deep learning in Python. Such a great experience.
  * Weird heart problems that turn out to be non life-threatening and that eventually go away.
  * I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjAirsGhn_z/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">run the legendary Bay to Breakers</a> 12k race in SF.
  * I visit my sister in Boulder and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjVZiq2BMrw/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we run Bolder Boulder</a>, a 10km race. It&#8217;s her first race!
  * Cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwZoIF6GRng" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Song of The Unborn</a>, by Steven Wilson.
  * Cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnLDun7DYmI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crosses</a>, by José González.
  * Watching The Room in SF with two massive titans: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bj2qW_JBNX0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tim Wiseau and Pau Guinart</a>.

  * Several <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmRi4EaBg8R/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arkaen shows</a> around the Bay Area and the sierras. So much fun.
  * My dearest friend Eduard and his partner Erika <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm1HnBbB_VM/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spend some days in California</a>.
  * Our work on [Multimodal Deep Learning for Music Recommendation][1] is published at the TISMIR journal.
  * My friend Erik gets <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm5CzFlhmS5/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">married</a> and I play a few tunes at his beautiful wedding in Tahoe
  * I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm7_2kpB8iM/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">go to Burning Man</a> and it&#8217;s fantastic and I <a href="/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">write</a> about it.

  * Night at the [opera in Barcelona with my dearest Ferran][4].
  * After 5 or 6 years, I&#8217;m back into rock climbing and it feels great.
  * [Los Pandejos rocking hard][5] at the UC Theatre.
  * Several weekend trips to beautiful California locations. My love deepens, both for Anita and California.
  * Yes, I go to [Blizzcon][6] to watch the Global Finals of Starcraft 2 for two consecutive days. Yes, it is amazing. (Yes, [Serral wins][7]).
  * [Thanksgiving in LA][8] (in the former mansion of Humphrey Bogart &#8211;life is ridiculous), and then [Eastern Sierras explorations][9]. By far, best days in California.
  * Cover of the jazz standard, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OAu9Daw6sI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">There Will Never Be Another You</a>.
  * NeurIPS in [Montreal][10].
