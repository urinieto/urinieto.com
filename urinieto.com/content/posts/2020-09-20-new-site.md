It only took 10 years and a pandemic to finally upgrade my personal website.
But I did it, and it feels to good to say goodbye to Wordpress and say hello to static websites (again).

I migrated my old, slow, and rarely updated website to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a quite simple to use and pretty powerful static site generator.
It's written in Go, which I had zero experience with, but the migration wasn't that bad.

Here's the tools I used:
- [Wordpress to Hugo Exporter](https://github.com/SchumacherFM/wordpress-to-hugo-exporter)
- [Anatole Theme](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole/)
- [Custom Python Script](https://github.com/urinieto/urinieto.com/blob/master/scripts/update_mds.py)

And I already feel like it was worth it.
I am writing this from my beloved terminal, using Vim on a Markdown file that once I push it to this site's [github repo](https://github.com/urinieto/urinieto.com), it will automatically update the final website. Magic!
Moreover, the new page is not only way **faster** (goodbye PHP + mySQL), but definitely **cheaper**!
I was paying around $100/year to host my old site, and this is completely free, hosted in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (thanks for the tip, Sergi!).
Also, wow, Netlify is awesome.

Anyway, with this upgrade I hope to be more motivated to publish stuff into the Internets, since I will no longer be embarrassed of a website that had to be upgraded long ago.

So, here I go!
