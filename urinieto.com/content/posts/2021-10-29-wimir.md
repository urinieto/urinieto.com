The [Women in Music Information Retrieval workshop](https://wimir.wordpress.com/2021/09/24/wimir-workshop-2021-project-guides/) just took place as part of a satellite event for [ISMIR 2021](https://ismir2021.ismir.net/), and I had the honor to be one of this year's project guides!

{{< img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/catalanflags21.png" alt="" width="" >}}

I gave a little talk on Music Structure Analysis, basically an overview of the paper we published at [TISMIR last year](https://transactions.ismir.net/articles/10.5334/tismir.54/).

I have much admiration for the work that the people at WiMIR are doing. 
Thanks to them, the ISMIR community has become a much more diverse one in the past few years.
Keep on rocking, titans! And see you at ISMIR 2021 :)
