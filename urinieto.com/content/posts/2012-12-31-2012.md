Another year goes by. So it&#8217;s time for me to review the important things I&#8217;ve done this year, so that my extremely limited memory won&#8217;t have to store all of this information, which will be now and forever on The Internet.

  * NEMISIG 2012 in Dartmouth
  * [Antikaraoke with Rachel][1]
