Four years ago I worked at a really nice startup in Spain called [Mobivery][1], doing some iPhone development. This company has grown so much that right now it&#8217;s probably the most established mobile apps company in Spain, having won the &#8220;#1 Best Working Place&#8221; in Spain in 2011. 

These guys now asked me to make short video about me in NY, as an ex-coworker. And here is the result (in Spanish). They have also [blogged about it][2].
