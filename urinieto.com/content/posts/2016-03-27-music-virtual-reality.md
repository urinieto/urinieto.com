When is the last time you&#8217;ve listened to an entire music album with complete full attention? That is, when have you sat down, relaxed, put your CD/vinyl/tape/Your Favorite Streaming Service and just do nothing but enjoy The Music? Since I haven&#8217;t done this in quite a while, and I assume most people haven&#8217;t either, I&#8217;ve been considering inviting people over to <emph>listen</emph> to an LP instead of watching a movie. We could also have popcorn. And beer.

Regardless, the guys at Harmonix (Guitar Hero, Dance Central), have been also thinking about it, and they are about to release a Virtual Reality system to enhance the Music experience, such that people get more excited to experience &#8220;just music.&#8221; They call this project Music VR, and it turns out they are using some technology I developed for them a couple of years ago! They employed a few MIR researchers to write algorithms to detect beat, onset, and large-scale structure. I&#8217;m excited to have contributed to this project, and can&#8217;t wait to try it our with a pair of VR glasses.
