Last week Jordan Rudess was invited to come to Stanford to give a performance with me as part of the Stanford Laptop Orchestra (SLOrk). He also took this chance to perform in LA and in San Francisco. I went with him to SF and presented my ReactPad and also jammed with him. We also visited different companies like Muse, Sonoma and Apple. It was a very intense week, but the effort was totally worth it. Jordan is an amazing musician, a passionate for the music technology, and an awesome person.

The SLOrk concert was a lot of fun, and everything went fine even though all of us -even Jordan!- were nervous about the performance. We have plenty of videos of that, but we&#8217;re still editing them, I will upload them as soon as possible. For now, here there are some pictures of the week. Thanks Ge for letting me putting this together, thanks Adam Sheppard and Xiang Zhang for help me out getting the funding for bringing Jordan, and of course thanks to Jordan for coming all the way from the East Coast to give such a wonderful performance.

Ahhh, good times!
