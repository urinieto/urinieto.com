Another year is passing by. And it&#8217;s a tradition to this blog to say something about it. Since it&#8217;s easier to make a search on the Internet, I will start with the description from the [wikipedia][1]: 

> 2010 (MMX) is a common year starting on a Friday and is the current year. In the Gregorian calendar, it was the 2010th year of the Common Era or the Anno Domini designation; the 10th year of the 3rd millennium and of the 21st century; and the 1st of the 2010s decade.
> 
> The United Nations has designated 2010 the International Year of Biodiversity and International Year of Youth.

Spain][6], [Spain winning the World Cup][7], and the loss of the greatest [Leslie Nielsen][8], I&#8217;m gonna make a brief list of _my_ 2010, chronologically ordered:
