This one took quite some time. But here it is, and couldn&#8217;t be prouder. IMHO, Beyond The Pale is one of the best songs ever written, and here is my rendition of it. Thanks to [Jordi Foraster][1] for the amazing solo, and Nathalie Alegre for the inspiration, acting, and post-production. Enjoy titans!
