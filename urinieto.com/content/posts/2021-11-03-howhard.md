Well, we did it: Los Pandejos released our first original track!
As part of Pandora/Sirius XM Performs, we put together not only this original track, but also a little silly video.

What a great honor to be part of this international rock band. Thanks Damon wood for the epic composition. Let's see how hard we can rock!
