Here it is titans: The epic world-wide collaboration of The Trooper, by Iron Maiden. I try to sing while I brush my teeth, because cleaner teeth make your vocals much better, because the air pressure can pass between your teeth and it produces some frequencies that wouldn&#8217;t exist otherwise.

Again, thanks to Andy Feehan to putting this together!
