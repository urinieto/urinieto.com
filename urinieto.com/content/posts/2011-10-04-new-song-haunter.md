I have been featured in the new album by [**The Cloud Runner**][1], a band from the UK with the great [Andy Feehan][2] as its leader and composer.

My voice is on the 9th track of the album, a song called **Haunter**. The lyrics are about the epic _A Song of Ice and Fire_ by **George R. R. Martin**. I was reading the second book of this amazing saga when I wrote the lyrics.

Here you have the song:

The voices were recorded at **Jarl&#8217;em All Studios**, where the rest of the music was recorded, mixed and mastered by Andy Feehan somewhere in the UK.

You can get the album [here][3].

Alright! Thanks Andy for putting this altogether!
