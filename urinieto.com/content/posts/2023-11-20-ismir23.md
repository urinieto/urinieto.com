[ISMIR](https://ismir2023.ismir.net/) is back in full swing with over 400 registrations, most of them in-person attendees in the beautiful city of Milan, Italy.
Once again, ISMIR proves that it is home to the most incredible research community I've ever witnessed, and I feel extremely lucky to be part of it.

Overall, I felt that this year's conversation had significantly shifted from last year's.
**Generative AI** was, as predicted, the hottest topic, and that lead to several interesting discussions on **ethics** and the fair usage of training data.
Additionally, there were several interesting approaches in the **symbolic domain**, which differs from the trend of past ISMIRs where audio-based approaches tended to dominate.

It's hard to pick the best papers, but here's my personal list of the top 10.
Here we go, titans!

# Best 10 Papers
