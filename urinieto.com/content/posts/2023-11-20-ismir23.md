[ISMIR](https://ismir2023.ismir.net/) is back in full swing with over 400 registrations, most of them in-person attendees in the beautiful city of Milan, Italy.
Once again, ISMIR proves that it is home to the most incredible research community I've ever witnessed, and I feel extremely lucky to be part of it.

Overall, I felt that this year's conversation had significantly shifted from last year's.
**Generative AI** was, unsurprisingly, the hottest topic, and that lead to several interesting discussions on **ethics** and the fair usage of training data.
Additionally, there were several interesting approaches in the **symbolic domain**, which differs from the trend of past ISMIRs where audio-based approaches tended to dominate.

It's hard to pick the best papers, but here's my personal top 10.
Here we go, titans!

# Best 10 Papers

### VampNet: Music Generation Via Masked Acoustic Token Modeling - Flores Garc√≠a  et al.

### Data Collection In Music Generation Training Sets: A Critical Analysis - Pereira et al.

Best paper Universal Music Group

### Towards Building A Phylogeny Of Gregorian Chant Melodies - Hajic jr et al.

### MoisesDB: A Dataset For Source Separation Beyond 4-Stems - Morreale et al.

### PESTO: Pitch Estimation With Self-supervised Transposition-equivariant Objective - Riou et al.


# Conclusion

Despite one of the two General Chairs (Augusto TODO) having had a serious health issue, and Fabio TODO being a newcomer to the community, this has been an incredible ISMIR.
Everything ran really smoothly, from the banquet to the sessions, passing through the jam session!
A word on that: some of us were a bit worried that there was not a lot of information about the ISMIR jam session this year (or rather, the available information was very different from what the ISMIR community is used to).
So the community stepped up and, after awesome performances with Mark d'Inverno and Joey Stuckey (TODO), Matthias Mauch ended up leading a really fun jam session where I had the pleasure to [scream]() for a little bit :)

Overall, congratulations to the organizers, volunteers, authors, and all participants for making this ISMIR 2023 an unforgettable one.
Hope to see you all in San Francisco next year!
