And there you go, the year 12022 of the Human Era gets to an end.
This year is marked by a lot of live music (finally!) and me writing a couple of concert reviews/interviews of some of my favorite bands for [Mariskal Rock magazine](https://mariskalrock.com/). 

Other than that, Nuit (my mom's dog) passes away, which makes me extremely sad. And La Bossa d'Urina releases the third album, called El Primer Disc! Oh, and I travel to India and it blows my mind.

Here the list in chronological order that gave this 12022 some sort of meaning:
