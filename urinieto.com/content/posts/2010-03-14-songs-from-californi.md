I have been working on a couple of songs for the [Advanced Sound Recording Technology][1] course at [CCRMA][2]. I am quite happy with the result, I definitively think the CCRMA Studio is a great place to record some music. I recorded these new songs with Roy Fejgin, another MST Student.

I finally learned quite a bit of Pro Tools HD, recording, mics placement, mixing, and even mastering. I decided that next quarter I will record a bunch more songs. I can&#8217;t wait to &#8220;live&#8221; in the studio for the next couple of months.

You can find the songs here: [Sea][3] and [Sol de Nit][4].

Roy Fejgin is on the piano, and he also wrote the music for &#8220;[Sea][3]&#8220;. He did a great job! Alright Roy!

I hope you like them, especially you Marina and Diana.
