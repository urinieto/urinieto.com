By living in the US I get to talk quite a bit about what Catalonia is within Spain with a lot of american people. And it always turns out to be a a very interesting conversation (at least for me!). Most of them don&#8217;t know what Catalonia or the Catalan language is, but when I tell them that some catalans would like Catalonia to become an independent state within the EU they usually react with surprise and skepticism. As if something like this could never happen to Spain, a country seen by many americans as united and indivisible.

Here it is a very interesting 40-min documentary by Gary Gibson about what is going on in Catalonia and in the rest of Spain right now. I think it tried to be as objective as possible, even though it&#8217;s highly biased towards the catalans. It is important to keep in mind that **not all catalans want the independence, and not all spaniards hate catalonia**. Apart from that, it is really interesting watching very influential spanish people (from both sides) talking about the subject.

Maybe it only matters to me on this side of the world, but I really found it interesting and worth watching. I wish everyone I have talked to about this in america could watch this video.
