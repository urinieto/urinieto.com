Conducted by thrash music director Charlie Forkish, the Headbang Orchestra proudly presents the first concerto ever written to be played by headbangers. Performed by Experimetal, an ensemble of 15 highly qualified bangers featuring noize soloists extraordinaire, Uri Nieto and Adam Somers, Cop de Cap is the Ultimate Metal Experiment Odessy that will make your heads want to bang. The libretto is about a young man that couldn&#8217;t find love until the day he found it.

Performed as part of the Stanford Laptop Orchestra Spring Concert in the Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Stanford University. June 2, 2010
