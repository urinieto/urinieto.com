This year at ICASSP we're presenting a novel technique to enhance a music signal via generative adversarial networks and diffusion probabilistic models.

The goal is to remove undesired noise and reverb while enhancing certain frequencies to make the signal as clean and crisp as possible before any potential addition of sound effects.

Here some examples:

(The original videos were obtained from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gTYISq4-4E) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liDQRLYu2EM) --the one in the middle was recorded by yours truly :-))


To do so, we used [MedleyDB-Solos](https://zenodo.org/record/1344103) to train a GAN to discriminate between clean, professionally recorded solo tracks and noisy clips with solo instruments.

Once the GAN is trained, we can feed it a noisy music signal to obtain an enhanced spectrogram.
Such spectrogram is then passed through a diffusion probabilistic model that serves as a music vocoding (we call it _musecoder_, because we're fancy), to generate the final waveform.

The full architecture overview is here:

We performed a survey with over 200 participants to rate the audio quality of our proposed technique. 
The results in terms of Mean Opinion Scores show that the output of our model is closer to the quality of professionally recorded musical instruments compared to other baselines, thus obtaining **state-of-the-art in terms of music signal enhancement**.
