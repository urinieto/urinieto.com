[Geo Synth][1] is the new app by Wizdom Music, and it is fantastic. It&#8217;s a new synthesizer with a very smart and useful arrangement of the notes. It comes with dozens of presets, but of course you&#8217;re free to create your own.

I&#8217;ve been playing with it for a while, and here is a little improvisation I made in my studio:

Highly recommended. I will for sure use it in my little tour in Catalonia this January.  
Alright!
