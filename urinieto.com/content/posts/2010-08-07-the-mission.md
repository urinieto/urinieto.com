I&#8217;m moving out. I switch coasts. So I wanted to go to [The Mission District][1] one last time, my favorite part of one of the most amazing cities I&#8217;ve ever been to. I&#8217;m gonna miss San Francisco so much, and especially this district originally founded by the priest [Francisco Pal√≥u][2] in 1776. Its colors, its buildings, its food, its people. And also its weather (no seasons at all, compared to the snow I&#8217;m gonna suffer in NY in the winter).

Good bye San Francisco.
