That&#8217;s right: **Jordan Rudess** is coming to Stanford to give a **free performance** next Thursday April 29th! This event is part of the **SLORkastic Chamber Music 2010**, a free concert by the whole class of [Composing, Coding, and Performance with Laptop Orchestra][1]. This concert is divided into 7 groups, and Jordan Rudess will be joining my group as a very special guest.

The event will take place at the [CCRMA Stage, The Knoll at Stanford University][2]. The concert will start at 8pm. You can find a link to the [facebook event here][3].

I will be sharing the stage with Jordan Rudess and Jorge Herrera (a PhD student at CCRMA that is helping me with the ReactPad pieces). Jordan will play the Eigenharp, the iPad, the iPhone and of course his keyboards. Jorge and I will play the iPad version of the [ReactPad][4], and I might use Jordan&#8217;s voice synthesizer as well.

I still can&#8217;t believe that I managed to bring Jordan from the east coast and that I will be sharing the stage with him. I&#8217;m really excited about this!

You can&#8217;t miss it!
