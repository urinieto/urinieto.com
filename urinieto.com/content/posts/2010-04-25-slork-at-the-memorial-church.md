Yesterday I was invited to play a short performance with SLOrk at the Stanford Memorial Church. The concert was for the next year admitted students, and the church was pretty packed. Ge Wang talked about CCRMA and about the Stanford Laptop Orchestra. It was a great experience! Thanks guys for inviting me.

Here there are some pics by Dave Kerr:
