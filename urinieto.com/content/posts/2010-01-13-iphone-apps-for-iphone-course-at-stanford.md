This quarter I signed up for the course [_Mobile Music_][1], taught by Professor [Ge Wang][2]. It is a course to write music code for Mobile devices, mostly focused on the **iPhone**. 

Yesterday was due the first assignment which was writing three small music apps for the iPhone. I must say that the [library][3] created initially for [Smule][4] and later modified for the [MoPho (Stanford Mobile Phone Orchestra)][5] is extremely amazing. 

Check out my small apps [here][6]. Enjoy titans!
