Dead people are usually nice. Living people as well. However, tv, books, press, swine flu and imagination always try to make us forget that. This book (like all Neil Gaiman&#8217;s), is different to any ordinary book. So here, the dead ones raise a little human baby and it grows up without knowing any living. In a Graveyard.

Gaiman publishes another book for younger audiences, however I enjoyed this one more than Coraline. Although I usually love McKean&#8217;s work, I really miss his colors in the paintings of this edition. Damn it, it was a long time since I read a book with drawings. I almost had forgot how pleasant it can be!

Recommended, of course. It&#8217;s Gaiman.
