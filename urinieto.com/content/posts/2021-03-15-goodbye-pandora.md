Last Friday was my last day at Pandora. I made a song to say goodbye:

In case you haven't watch the video yet (which contains all relevant details), I'll be become a researcher at Adobe Research at the end of the month.
I'll be joining forces with [Justin](https://www.justinsalamon.com/) and other massive titans doing research of creative Machine Learning for audio.

While sad to be leaving Pandora (because it really is an amazing place to work, and I already miss the humans there), I'm so excited for my next gig! <3
