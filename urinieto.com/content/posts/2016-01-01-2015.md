What a year! So many travels, milestones and events. Some extremely good. Some pretty damn bad. But hey, we&#8217;re still here, making and producing noise, and listing all of these things that sum up my year so that people in the future understand how stupid and silly some humans were during the 10s.

  * La Bossa d&#8217;Urina goes on its [fifth World Tour][1]. This time I sing without a voice.
  * My grandma dies, which dramatically enlarges the range of pain I thought I could ever endure. I miss her so much.
  * My sister moves to Colorado to finish her undergrad at CU Boulder ([vamos][2]!).
  * I become a Doctor. My dissertation is [here][3]. And the video of my defense is [here][4] (thanks to Dad and Lesa to come all the way from Barcelona!).
  * I play with my friend, the titan, Ramón Rodriguez, from The New Raemon, [in NYC][5] (see a little [video][6]). After the show, he decides that he would produce and publish the first La Bossa d&#8217;Urina album. Woah.
  * I really miss my grandma.
  * I publish the Music Structure Analysis Framework ([MSAF][7]).
  * I become a consultant to [Cord Worldwide][8] for a project that will last around 3 months.
  * Venga Monja in NYC (titan).
  * Cover of [Beyond the Pale][9], which took so long to put together (but I&#8217;m so happy with the results!).
  * We [record][10] an EP with my metal band Midnight Blue (listen to it [here][11]!).
  * I visit my sister in Colorado and I fall in love with Boulder.
  * It&#8217;s commencement time, and my mom comes all the way from Barcelona to New York to see me with [these fancy clothes][12].
  * Natishrimp gets accepted to Oxford University (woah!).
  * Cover of [The Eldar][13] by Blind Guardian with the titanest Eren Başbuğ.
  * I switch to terminal vim because Mans comes to visit and he always inspires me (it was so great to see him, his son, and his wife). Life as a coder is even better.
  * We perform for the first and last time with Midnight Blue in Manhattan, you can watch the video made by Nomasdf Productions [here][14] (eternal thanks RAFANG!).
  * I go to Barcelona to record the first album of [La Bossa d&#8217;Urina][15], with my dearest friend Daniel Bolsa, with my titanic friend Ramón Rodriguez as the producer, with Cydonia Records as the record label, with Lluís Cots as the sound technician, with Núria and Xavi as the fucking awesome hosts, and with so many other amazing titans who make this shit happen.
  * We move to Oakland because I become a Data Scientist at Pandora (woah!). It&#8217;s so hard to leave NYC, though.
  * Our neighbors and landlord are the best.
  * Natishrimp moves to Oxford for 9 months.
  * Working at Pandora is awesome.
  * So many titans get married in NYC (three weddings in less than a month). Congratulations!
  * La Bossa d&#8217;Urina has a [new website][16]. And a [bandcamp][17].
  * ISMIR in Málaga is fantastic. We present [this stuff][18]. I am the chair of the Jam Session, which turns out to be a really fun event (at least for [me][19]!). Since I&#8217;m in Europe, I visit [Natis][20], family, and [friends][21] (Oxford is [beautiful][22]!).
  * My dad buys a house in Canovelles. Congrats!
  * My hack of [Meshuggahme][23] wins the Best Demo Hack at the Pandora Hackathon!
  * Our first album of La Bossa d&#8217;Urina is [released][24], and it comes with a mind-blowing [video][25] that was made by Nomasdf Productions (you&#8217;re the best RAFANG).
  * It&#8217;s been over a year since the last time I ate meat in the US. Pretty easy so far. And feeling (a tiny tiny tiny) better about the environment. Alright.
  * [Thanksgiving in Colorado][26] should become a tradition now that my sister has been accepted to a Master&#8217;s program in CU Boulder!
  * My grandma is deeply missed.
  * [Christmas in Miami][27] with Natishrimp&#8217;s family.
  * First New Year&#8217;s Eve in San Francisco [is beautiful][28].
