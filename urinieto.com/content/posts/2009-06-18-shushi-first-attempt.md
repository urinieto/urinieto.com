Lately I&#8217;m starting to be a huge fan of sushi. I think that&#8217;s since the day I discovered that you can actually put Philadelphia cheese inside the rolls. Oh man, that&#8217;s extremely delicious. So, last weekend, Diana and me -people who don&#8217;t know what to do with their free time and life in general- tried to make some sushi. 

We made some maki with crab, salmon, cucumber, avocado and Philadelphia, and some nigiri with shrimps and salmon. It didn&#8217;t look extremely good, but the taste was quite ok. Wasabi was shit though. Don&#8217;t buy the cheapest Wasabi, it tastes like paint/glue.

So, there it goes my little tribute to Bobby Shaftoe.
