Last week I had the pleasure to meet the guys form [Project RnL][1]. These amazing musicians from Tel Aviv came to NYU and then they played a [show in Tarrytown, NY, with the wizard Jordan Rudess and the young turkish maestro Eren Başbuğ][2].

I can&#8217;t put into words how extremely elaborated and sophisticated the music of Project RnL is, so I will just leave a video of these guys with Jordan Rudess playing and you&#8217;ll get the idea (the first two minutes of this song is made only with iPads!):
