We did it. We managed to squeeze 7 shows in 21 days all around the world. More specifically, eastern Catalonia.

This time the tour is named after our lifetime hero: Master Roshi (aka Follet Tortuga in Catalan), who wrote the Pillars Of The Earth, saved the world several times, and I&#8217;m sure he will save it again during the Trumpocalypse.

Here you have the dates with the locations, see you there, brave titans:
