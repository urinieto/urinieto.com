I love this song. So much. I tried to cover it, but of course this doesn&#8217;t compare to the original in any possible sense. Maybe in the title. And the chords (almost). Regardless, this is for Natishrimpers The Llama, who lives in that beautiful country surrounded by hobbits and muggles. Miss you guapa.
