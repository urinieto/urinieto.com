This semester I took a great course at [Steinhard School][1] ([NYU][2]) called _Scoring for Films and Multimedia_. I&#8217;ve been composing quite a bit, and I feel good about it! The Professor Ron Sadoff gave us great advice, and it&#8217;s been a really good experience being part of this.

Here you have some excerpts of the music I made. Enjoy!
