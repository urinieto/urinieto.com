Last month, I was invited to give a talk at [MagniMind Academy](https://magnimindacademy.com/).
I took that chance to go over the Music Information Retrieval problem of Music Segmentation from a high level (similar to the paper we published at [TISMIR last year](https://transactions.ismir.net/articles/10.5334/tismir.54/)), and then focus on our latest work published at [ISMIR just last month](https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2021/paper/000074.pdf).

Here you have the video of the talk, unabridged:

So happy to have participated in this talk series, and would like to end this post by thanking the organizers for having me and for all the attendees for the really thoughtful questions!
