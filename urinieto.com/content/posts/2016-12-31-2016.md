Years are starting to pass by at high speeds. Not light speed, not hyperloop speed, but maybe high-speed-trains speed. My first year in Oakland is waiving goodbye, and while crazy shit has happened in the world this year, I certainly can&#8217;t complain of who and what is around me. I feel extremely privileged and thankful for having had the opportunity to be on this fast-paced ride that only stops once. Let&#8217;s keep moving.

List of _things_ that gave meaning to this little (highly probably simulated) life:

  * Cover of [Time Travelers][1] by Riverside
  * [Performance][2] with Los Pandejos at the Pandora Music Analyst Fest
  * I join [Arkaen][3], a new metal band from Concord that will save the world
  * My music structure analysis algorithms make it to the new [Harmonix Music VR][4] game by the developers of Rock Band
  * First time [skiing][5] in Tahoe like a real white male in his 30s who works in tech
  * Dagstuhl Seminar in [Germany][6]
  * Nathalie studies in Oxford and I visit [her][7] and it is more magical than Hogwarts

  * Freak Kitchen features the [cover][13] I made a few years ago in their page
  * Pliny The Elder becomes my favorite beer
  * Jordan Rudess invites me to his [backstage room][14] to talk and play with some of his newest toys
  * We [record][15] our first demo with Arkaen
  * James Hetfield suddenly shows up in a Corrosion of Conformity [show][16] and reminds me how awesome the Bay Area is
  * Cover of [England][17] by The National (for Natis)
  * One of my dreams come true: cover of [The Beginning and The End by Anathema][18] WITH JORDAN RUDESS
