A couple of weeks ago, the [Music Hack Day took place in New York][1]. I attended with some fellows from NYU and Stanford, and it was an extremely amazing time. It was my first time I attended to a MHD, and I had a lot of fun, I made a lot of new contacts in the field, and&#8230; I created the [Screaminator][2], and iOS scream detector that won the [SoundCloud][3] prize!

Thank you Hannes for the recording!

I am working alongside with [Juan Astasio][6] to release this app to the AppStore. Hopefully it will be ready in a month or so. Stay tuned!
