It is fascinating to find this kind of paragraphs in [classical probability literature][1] by [Laplace][2]:

> Nearly all our knowledge is problematical; and in the small number of things which we are able to know with certainty, even in the mathematical sciences themselves, the principal means for ascertaining truth -induction and analogy- are based on probabilities

Philosophers (some call them scientists now), the real predictors of the future.
