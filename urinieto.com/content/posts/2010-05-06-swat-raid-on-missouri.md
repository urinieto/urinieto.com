I was totally shocked after watching this video:



I copy and paste from the original source:

> SWAT team breaks into home, fires seven rounds at family&#8217;s pit bull and corgi (?!) as a seven-year-old looks on.
> 
> They found a &#8220;small amount&#8221; of marijuana, enough for a misdemeanor charge. The parents were then charged with child endangerment.
> 
> So smoking pot = &#8220;child endangerment.&#8221; Storming a home with guns, then firing bullets into the family pets as a child looks on = necessary police procedures to ensure everyone&#8217;s safety.
> 
> Just so we&#8217;re clear.

This is a really strange country where I live in.
