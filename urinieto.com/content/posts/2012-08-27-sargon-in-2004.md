Thanks to my MacBook Pro [that died a few days ago][1], I found the following video in my old HD. So many good old memories came to my mind. This is back in 2004, <del datetime="2012-08-28T15:42:22+00:00">when we opened for EPICA</del> for the Octavo Día Festival, in Mephisto, Barcelona (Spain). Here you have it titans, enjoy!
