If I broke a thousand promises  
If I broke a few I&#8217;m lost  
If I thought you were another girl  
For you to come around  
Would you care about our mistakes?

Then I thought you were a beautiful ghost  
Cause you thought I was insane  
If I brought you a thousand miracles  
For you to understand  
That I will not play your game

How long will you wait to tell me you don&#8217;t feel a thing?  
How long will you wait to hold me till the end of my days?  
I&#8217;ll wait until twilight with costumes I will not wear  
How long will you wait to tell me you don&#8217;t feel a thing?

All the times I broke in two  
All the times I left  
Thinking I was a dream for you  
And you didn&#8217;t feel the same  
Would you care about our mistakes?

Confusion is not wonderful  
Make a wish, you&#8217;ll make me wait  
All these days I&#8217;ve been so critical  
and cynical  
Anyway  
Tears of joy run down my face

How long will you wait to tell me you don&#8217;t feel a thing?  
How long will you wait to hold me till the end of my days?  
I&#8217;ll wait until the twilight with costumes I will not wear  
How long will you wait to tell me you don&#8217;t feel a thing?
