  On Sunday I went to Concord, CA, to see Dream Theater and Iron Maiden. But the best thing was, Jordan Rudess gave me two aftershow passes and I got to meet the band! These guys are great, I talked to them, they signed my Dream Theater CD collection, we passed through Iron Maiden crazy &#8220;army&#8221; of trailers, and we took some pics of everything.

Unfortunately we didn&#8217;t see drugs or sex (and few rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll, actually it was more like prog-metal), and we couldn&#8217;t meet the guys from Iron Maiden either.

Anyway, it was a great night. Thanks Jordan for the passes! Best of luck for the rest of the tour and for the amazing MorphWiz!
