**UPDATE** (6/19/11): Fortunately no, it&#8217;s not the end of South Park. [Watch it on the daily news][1]. Ahhh I love these guys so much!

(**Warning**: Spoilers ahead!)

I am a huge South Park fan. It&#8217;s my favorite TV comedy show by far (only comparable to [Monty Python&#8217;s Flying Circus][2]), and, unfortunately, it seems it&#8217;s coming to an end.

Last South Park Episode, [&#8220;You&#8217;re Getting Old&#8221;][3], it&#8217;s probably the most deeply moving South Park episode of all times. It&#8217;s the end of the first half of the 15th Season, but it can easily be seen as the **series grand finale**. And it&#8217;s too damn amazing.

It&#8217;s Stand&#8217;s 10th Birthday and something terribly wrong starts happening to him: **everything turns to shit around him**. The doctor tells him that he&#8217;s become a _&#8220;cynical asshole&#8221;_. 

[{{< img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/southPark-caca-500x266.png" alt="" title="southPark-caca" width="500" height="266" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1185" >}}][5]

Apparently Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park, are using this episode as a metaphor to explain their current situation. They don&#8217;t feel the same about the show anymore. They are too busy doing other things (e.g. [The Book Of Mormon][6]), or simply their interests have changed and are growing apart. It seems like they&#8217;re tight to a contract that makes them unhappy.

[{{< img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/southpark-separate-500x313.png" alt="" title="southpark-separate" width="500" height="313" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1187" >}}][7]

Sharon Marsh, Stand&#8217;s mother, gives an amazing speech that reflects this at the end of the episode: 

> I&#8217;m unhappy too. We both are obviously. How much longer can we keep doing this? It&#8217;s like the same shit happens over and over, and then in a week it just resets until it happens again. Every week it&#8217;s kind of the same story in a different way but it keeps getting more and more ridiculous. (&#8230;) I can&#8217;t fake it anymore. You seem kind of shitty to me.

[{{< img src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/southpark-unhappy-500x341.png" alt="" title="southpark-unhappy" width="500" height="341" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1189" >}}][8]

Hopefully South Park will continue. But if it doesn&#8217;t, it will have the best series grand finales for a comedy show I&#8217;ve ever seen. And it will remain the best comedy show of all times. 

Until they do something completely different.
