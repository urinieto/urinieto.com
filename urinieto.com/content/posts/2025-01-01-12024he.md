And just like that, the year 12,024 of the Human Era is over. 
And what a year it has been!
Biggest highlights: I got married and organized ISMIR in San Francisco.
N.B.: organizing a large international research conference is way more stressful and time consuming and less fun than getting married (in case you're having crazy thoughts).

On top of that, I travelled an embarrassing amount, emitting more CO2 than most humans.
Sorry planet and future generations, this is truly terrible and it's gotten out of hand.
