Some experiments I did last year as part of a failed audition with [Swingset Committee][1]:

I quite like this song though. The older I am, the gayer I become.

Oh, the voice was recorded here at Jarl&#8217;em All Studios. This Rode NT1-A mic is all you need to make a decent vocals recording. And so cheap! Alrightht
