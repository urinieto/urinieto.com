When [Jordan Rudess came to Stanford][1], he took this chance to give a couple of performances presenting the [new synthesizer by Roland called Gaya][2] in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. In the very last minute, Jordan asked me if I wanted to present some of my apps in his performance in San Francisco. This performance took place at [Pyramind][3], a very cool music production company that written the score for videogames such as Prince of Persia, Halo or God of War. And here I am presenting the [VoxCarina][4] and the [ReactPad][5] at [Pyramind][3], SF:

After my presentation, Jordan asked me to join him and [Moldover][6] (a very interesting artist from the Bay Area that crafts his own instruments) to jam together with our creations. Here you have the evidence:

It was a great night, and I want to thank Jordan Rudess for inviting me, and also the guys at Pyramind for recording these videos. It was so ALRIGHT.
