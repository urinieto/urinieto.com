Here you will find the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad Applications I have developed (or helped developing) and are published on the App Store:

**SCREAMINATOR**

This is a project that I started some time ago. I developed the technology for detecting &#8220;screams&#8221; or &#8220;growls&#8221; at Stanford back in early 2010. I put that technology into the [**Growl Hero** desktop app][1] (it&#8217;s free, you can download it from [here][2]). 

After that, I port the technology into the iOS platform, and created a hack called **Screaminator** for the Music Hack Day in New York, in February 2011 (you can find the wiki page [here][3]). I got some media coverage [here][4] and [here][5], since I won the Best SoundCloud App. Alright! The app used the mic of the iPhone/iPod Touch to detect your level of scream and give you a score depending on how good you&#8217;re doing it.

Finally, I joined forces with Juan Astasio, an amazing New York based graphic designer, and we finally developed a comercial version of the **Screaminator**. You can visit the [Official Screaminator Website][6] for more info.

**MorphWiz**

App developed by [Jordan Rudess][8] and Kevin Chartier. I helped with little snippets of code. It&#8217;s the ultimate instrument for the iPhone and iPad. Simply amazing. More info [here][9]. You can download it [here][10].

**VoxCarina**

Instrument that is half an Ocarina, half a TalkBox. You don&#8217;t have to blow to produce sound, but you should put your mouth close to the speaker to shape the sound with your vocal tract! Free in the AppStore.

**ReactPad**

This is my final project for the [Music-256b/Computer Science-476b course][15] at Stanford. It is based on the [Reactable][16] from the [Music Technology Group][17] in Barcelona. It is not published to the AppStore for some copyrights and ethical reasons. Read more on [the official ReactPad web page][18]. It works on the iPhone/iPod Touch, but on iPad is even better : )
